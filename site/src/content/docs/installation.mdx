`@graphql-ts/schema` is for **constructing** a GraphQL schema. If you're looking for a tool for type-safe **querying**, check out [gql.tada](https://gql-tada.0no.co).

To get started, you'll need to install `@graphql-ts/schema` and `graphql`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install graphql @graphql-ts/schema
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm add graphql @graphql-ts/schema
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add graphql @graphql-ts/schema
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Using `@graphql-ts/schema` starts with the `g` object which is a set of functions that mirror the GraphQL.js API, but with added type-safety.

To create `g`, you need to call `gWithContext` with a context type. The context type defines the type of the context that resolvers receive. You'll generally want to export this from a module so you can use it in your schema definition. You'll also want to export a type alias for `g` like `type g<T> = gWithContext.infer<T>`, [you'll use this later](/types/object#circular-types).

```ts twoslash
// g.ts
import { gWithContext } from "@graphql-ts/schema";

export type Context = {};

export const g = gWithContext<Context>();
export type g<T> = gWithContext.infer<T>;
```

Now you can use `g` to define your schema, you'll probably start with a query type, like this:

```ts twoslash
// schema.ts
// @filename: g.ts
import { gWithContext } from "@graphql-ts/schema";

export type Context = {};

export const g = gWithContext<Context>();
export type g<T> = gWithContext.infer<T>;
// @filename: schema.ts
// ---cut---
import { g } from "./g";
import { GraphQLSchema } from "graphql";

const Query = g.object()({
  name: "Query",
  fields: {
    hello: g.field({
      type: g.String,
      resolve: () => "world",
    }),
  },
});

const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
  query: Query,
});
```

If we print that schema in GraphQL SDL, it looks like this:

```graphql
# schema.graphql
type Query {
  hello: String
}
```

You've now created a GraphQL schema using `@graphql-ts/schema`! ðŸŽ‰

This `schema` object can be used with any server that works with GraphQL.js schema, such as [GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server), [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server), [graphql-http](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-http), etc.
